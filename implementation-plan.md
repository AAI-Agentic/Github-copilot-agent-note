Implement the project-plans/execution-plan.md step by step. Follow these guidelines:
1. Complete one step at a time.
2. After completing a step, prompt for approval
3. Once I say APPROVED, add a checkmark to the step title in the plan and commit changes to current branch
4. Strictly follow code snippets in the plan, do not invent anything.
