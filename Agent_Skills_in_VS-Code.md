# Use Agent Skills in VS Code

ttps://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/agent-skills

You can configure additional locations where VS Code searches for skills by using the 
`chat.agentSkillsLocations`

 setting. This is useful for sharing skills across projects or keeping them in a central location.
